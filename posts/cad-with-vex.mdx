Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a online method of planning out the robot, by creating 3D models, they can visualize how different parts fit together and ensure proper functionality. 

# initial

I learnt Cad for VEX during the winter break of 2022. I used Autodesk Inventor as it has lots of documentation for how to use vex parts with it. I was able to make many basic cads that helped me and i learnt alot of new things along the way.

# advanced rendering

during the fall of 2023, i started to look into more advanced rendering, mainly for media.

# poster

in jan we did a render with our new block to show the hight of it, we then printed as a poster, a challenge we had was pixelation as the poster was very big so we did this render in 20k.

# simulation

In feb we wanted a big piece of polycarbonate to act as a sled to go over a obsticale and we did many simulations in order to calculate how many layers we needed and what shapes were most oplimal.
